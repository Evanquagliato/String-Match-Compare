# String-Match-Compare
Have you ever wondered how many US states don't share a letter with the word Mackerel? Well now you can find the answer! 

With this console app you can input a word or phrase, and it will compare your phrase to each US state in a .txt 
to see if any states don't have a match. 

You can load any words at any length into the .txt in this project and it'll scan those. It is built to be able to scale to any size
